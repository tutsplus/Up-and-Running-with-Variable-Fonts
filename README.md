#### Instructor: [Kezz Bracey](https://tutsplus.com/authors/kezz-bracey)

Variable fonts are the next big thing in web typography. They allow for more creativity and design freedom than web designers have ever had with type before. And that’s all while simultaneously reducing your font load time down to a half, third, quarter or even less!

In this course you’ll learn what variable fonts are, why they’re such a big step forward, and everything you need to know to start designing with them and using them in your websites.

**Available on [Envato Tuts+](https://tutsplus.com/courses) from June, 2018**
